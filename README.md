The manuscript develops a statistical model describing the fitness effects of amino acid replacements across proteins. Using data from over 350,000 mutations obtained through deep mutational scanning, the study shows that context-dependent mutational effects generally follow truncated exponential distributions, with the mean determining the probability of a beneficial mutation. This model reconciles the predictability of evolutionary substitution patterns with variability in mutational outcomes, offering insights for protein engineering, variant effect prediction, and evolutionary biology.
